## Welcome to My Online Store [Footprints](https://footprintz.netlify.app/)

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a framework for building server-rendered React applications. It also utilizes Axios for making API requests, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Framer Motion for animations.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, clone the repository and run npm install to install all of the dependencies.

To start a development server, run npm run dev. This will start the server on http://localhost:3000 and will automatically reload the page when changes are made.

Please note that this is a mock online store, and as such, any purchases made will not be processed.
